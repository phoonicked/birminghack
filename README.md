- **Conversational Engagement** – Initiates natural, voice-based interactions with visitors, gathering valuable information through targeted questions

- **Intelligent Interaction Logging** – Every guest conversation, image, and data point is securely logged in the cloud for later review.

- **Comprehensive Guest History** – Access a detailed, searchable contact list of all guest interactions via a user-friendly web interface.

- **Instant Notifications** – Receive real-time alerts whenever a new guest is detected, keeping you always in the loop.

## How Does Ocular Work?

Ocular continuously monitors your home with a dedicated camera system. When a guest is detected, the system immediately initiates a conversation using the Neuphonic API. The AI agent asks key questions, processes the responses, and provides a tailored reply—all in real time. Every detail from the interaction—images, names, and conversation logs—is stored in a secure cloud-based system, giving you full visibility into who’s visiting and what was discussed.

## Workflow
Detection:

The camera instantly detects a guest approaching your home.

Interaction:

The AI agent starts a voice conversation, asking key questions to gather essential guest information.

Response:

The agent processes answers on the spot, generating context-aware responses using a trained AI model.

Data Logging:

Every detail—images, interaction transcripts, and metadata—is logged securely in the cloud.

Webapp Access:

Access and manage a comprehensive guest history through an intuitive, web-based interface.
